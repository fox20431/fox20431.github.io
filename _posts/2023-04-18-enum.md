# Enum

Enum is short for **enumerate**.

An enum is a special "class" representing a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables) While an enum can implement interfaces, it cannot be extended.

An enum is essentially a singleton pattern. It can be initialized with a constructor, but it cannot be instantiated.

## Method

`instance.toString()`

It returns the name of initialize by default. 

`Class.values()/valueOf()`

It returns all initializations or an instance that is a specified name.

`instance.ordinal()`

It returns the order of the instance in all instances.
