# HomeBrew使用指南

## Preface

HomeBrew安装应用位置`/usr/local`。

HomeBrew提供两种类型应用：

- Formulae：命令行应用；
- Cast：图形界面应用。

查看HomeBrew配置命令行：
```sh
brew config
```

## Basic Command

安装和卸载

```sh
# install
brew install <package_name>
# uninstall
brew uninstall <package_name>
# search
brew search <package_name>
```

## Taps

`taps`翻译为`水龙头`。

> `brew tap` adds more repositories to the list of formulae that `brew` tracks, updates, and installs from. By default, `tap` assumes that the repositories come from GitHub, but the command isn’t limited to any one location.

HomeBrew的tap命令会添加第三方库：

```sh
# makes a clone of the repository at https://github.com/user/homebrew-repo. After that, brew will be able to work on those formulae as if they were in Homebrew’s canonical repository. You can install and uninstall them with brew [un]install, and the formulae are automatically updated when you run brew update. (See below for details about how brew tap handles the names of repositories.)
brew tap <user/repo>
# makes a clone of the repository at URL. Unlike the one-argument version, URL is not assumed to be GitHub, and it doesn’t have to be HTTP. Any location and any protocol that Git can handle is fine.
brew tap <user/repo> <URL>
# migrates tapped formulae from a symlink-based to directory-based structure. (This should only need to be run once.)
brew tap --repair 
# removes the given taps. The repositories are deleted and brew will no longer be aware of their formulae. brew untap can handle multiple removals at once.
brew untap user/repo [user/repo user/repo ...] 
```

## Services

HomeBrew的服务管理，相比Mac自带的`launchctl`，更容易上手。

HomeBrew安装管理命令行：

```shell
brew tap homebrew/services
```

使用HomeBrew的服务管理：

```sh
brew services <other_command>
```

## Rmtree

该方案可以自主卸载依赖。

安装
```shell
brew tap beeftornado/rmtree
```

命令使用
```shell
brew rmtree <package_name>
```

## 查看依赖

```sh
brew deps --tree --installed
```
