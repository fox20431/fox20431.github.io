## Definition（定义）

a precise and unambiguous description of the meaning of a mathematical term. It characterizes the meaning of a word by giving all the properties and only those properties that must be true.

一个清晰明确的描述数学术语的意思。它通过给出的所有真实的性质表征词语的意思。

## Theorem（定理）

a mathematical statement that is proved using rigorous mathematical reasoning. In a mathematical paper, the term theorem is often reserved for the most important results.

一个通过严格数学结论被证明的数学表述。在数学论文中，定理术语通常用于最重要的结论。

## Lemma（引理）

a minor result whose sole purpose is to help in proving a theorem. It is a stepping stone on the path to proving a theorem. Very occasionally lemmas can take on a life of their own (Zorn's lemma, Urysohn's lemma, Burnside's lemma,Sperner's lemma).

## Corollary（推论）
a result in which the (usually short) proof relies heavily on a given theorem (we often say that this is a corollary of Theorem A").

## Proposition（命题）
a proved and often interesting result, but generally less important than a theorem.

## Conjecture（推测，猜想）
a statement that is unproved, but is believed to be true (Collatz conjecture, Goldbach conjecture, twin prime conjecture).

## Claim（断言）
an assertion that is then proved. It is often used like an informal lemma.

## Axiom/Postulate（公理/假设）

a statement that is assumed to be true without proof. These are the basic building blocks from which all theorems are proved (Eu-clid's ve postulates, Zermelo-Frankel axioms, Peano axioms).

## Identity（恒等式）
a mathematical expression giving the equality of two (often variable) quantities (trigonometric identities, Euler's identity).

## Paradox（悖论）
a statement that can be shown, using a given set of axioms and de nitions, to be both true and false. Paradoxes are often used to show the  inconsistencies in a awed theory (Russell's paradox). The term paradox is often used informally to describe a surprising or counterintuitive result that follows from a given set of rules  (Banach-Tarski paradox, Alabama paradox, Gabriel's horn).
