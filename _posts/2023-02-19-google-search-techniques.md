## Common search techniques

### Search social media

Put `@` in front of a word to search social media. For example: `@twitter`.

### Search for a price

Put `$ `in front of a number. For example: `camera $400`.

### Search hashtags

Put `# `in front of a word. For example: `#throwbackthursday`

### Exclude words from your search

Put `-` in front of a word you want to leave out. For example, `jaguar speed -car`

### Search for an exact match

Put a word or phrase inside quotes. For example, `"tallest building"`.

### Search within a range of numbers

Put `.. `between two numbers. For example, `camera $50..$100`.

### Combine searches

Put "`OR`" between each search query. For example, `marathon OR race`.

### Search for a specific site

Put "`site:`" in front of a site or domain. For example, `site:youtube.com `or `site:.gov`.

### Search for related sites

Put "`related:`" in front of a web address you already know. For example, `related:time.com`.

### See Google’s cached version of a site

Put "`cache:`" in front of the site address.

Important: Not all search operators return exhaustive results. 

### Search URL

FOr example, we wanna pages whose urls contain **zju and/or cs**, so we can construct our search like this:

```sh
inurl:cs zju
```

requires all the keywords:

```sh
allinurl:cs zju
```

### Search Title

intitle: zju

allintitle: zju

### Search Text

intext:

allintext:

### Search file type

filetype: pdf
