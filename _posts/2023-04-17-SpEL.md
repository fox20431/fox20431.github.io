# SpEL

Since I've been using the `Spring Framework` a lot lately, I realized the `SpEL(Spring Express Language)` is important for the usage of `Spring Framework`.

The article mainly refers to [the Spring official document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/spel.html).

- `#` - Refers to the variable
- `@` - Refers to the bean hosted in the context
- `$` - Refers to the property of `application.properties`
